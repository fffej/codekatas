Here are the rules of Cows and bulls
 
Setup
One player secretly writes a four-digit number on a piece of paper, such that each digit is different.
Gameplay
The other player takes turns to guess the number. The first player responds by announcing the number of matches, as follows: a digit correctly guessed in the correct place scores a bull, while a digit which is in the number in a different location scores a cow. So, if the secret number is 8045. a guess of 0865 would score two cows and one bull. The guesser carries on until they have guessed the number correctly.
 
The aim of this exercise is to write a program that will play the role of the guesser. You can either play the role of the person with the secret number yourself, or write some code to do this, but either way, your solution should try to arrive at the correct answer in the fewest number of guesses.
