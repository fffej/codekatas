Hello all,

1. Write a program to compress a list of words into the shortest string that contains all the words. For example, given
    testing 
    ginger 
    german 
    minutes 

Your program should output
    minutestingingerman 

2.Use your program to compress the following sentence into the smallest such string: never eat peas in anger on vertical seating for they easily form germs like german measles and mange
